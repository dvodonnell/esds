# Externality Source Data Standard

## Context

This standard exists to allow markets to readily consume data pertaining to externalities involved in the business of both private and public organizations. It allows the market to "price" goods, services and operations according to a range of external factors.

Because accuracy is important to consumers, the standard is based on very primary, granular information from the day-to-day operations of a business, down to individual events such as payments, the manufacture of individual products, and the storage of individual data entities. The market may not need to know this level of detail to price effectively, so the standard allows for both granular and aggregated representations of an organizations underlying information.

The standard is governed by a large, global consortium of organizations including the United Nations, individual governments, NGOs and private companies. Most of the information represented in the standard is opt-in, but organizations are encouraged to be as complete as possible to allow consumers full ability to assess goods and services based on the externalities that matter most to them.

### What this includes



### What it does not include

This specification does not include information tailored to a specific consumer of the data, for example a list of which data entities an organization holds for a specific person. It should be noted that the underlying definition and possible storage locations for those data entities is part of this specification.

There is a related (TBD) specification that determines consumer-tailored output.

## Principles

### Primary data only

No part of the ESDS shall be based on secondary or "processed" information, for example that which is based on modelling or industry averages. While consumers of ESDS-compliant data may choose to apply this secondary processing, the standard itself should not endorse any of the may presumptions, opinions and other unknowns inherent in projected/extrapolated/modelled data.

### Judgement-free

No part of ESDS shall make assessements of the data provided, through scoring or any judgement based on "values". 

### Transparency

Wherever possible, ESDS data should be made publicly accessible for free use by market actors. That said, the standard encompasses the definition of granular operations within an organization, such as individual transactions or payments to individuals/employees, which understandably may not be appropriate for the public realm by private organizations. The standard therefore allows in many places for commutable return of either granular or aggregated data. 

### Optionality

The transparency principle means that organizations may choose to omit certain segments of information covered by ESDS if they believe it should not be shared publicly.

No part of ESDS should incentivise or de-incentivise the sharing of any particular portion of data.

### Anonymity of individuals
